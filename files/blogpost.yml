At the back of our minds, however, we still hoped that we could join a bee tour while waiting for our orders to be served. Unfortunately, the latest tour had already started and the next one won't start until a couple of hours later. We agreed to just drop the idea and enjoy the rest of what the place has to offer.

Be wise in giving your preferred offer but don't forget to be reasonable too even if the conversion is in your favor.

You can buy tickets at the circus venue too for the same price. The show starts at 8:00pm and it's free seating so make sure to be there a bit earlier to secure better seats. Preferred seating is also available for 35USD (Adult).

Having a glass of cocktail and snacks with Cambodian acoustic songs in the background while catching the afternoon rays on a roof deck is a travel experience I will always remember.
